\section{Methods Accuracy Report}
    % Results for each method you tried (try to use checkpoints to get test set accuracy for each of your methods)

    \subsection{Generative Methods}
    \subsection{Discriminative Methods}
    \subsection{Instance based Methods}
    \subsection{Regularization Method}
    \subsection{Semi-supervised dimmensionality reduction}

\section{Methods Analysis}
    % Analysis of your experiments. What worked and what didn’t work? Why not? What did you do to try to fix it? Simply saying “I tried XX and it didn’t work” is not enough.

\section{Visualization}
    % An interesting visualization of one of your models. For instance, find the words that most correlate with the outcome.
